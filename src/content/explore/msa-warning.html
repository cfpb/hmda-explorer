<strong class="highlight">Important note:</strong> Please use caution when analyzing Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) over multiple years, as the 2014 HMDA data use the <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/metro/data/metrodef.html">updated MSA definitions</a>, released Feb 2013.  For example, some MSAs may show the same name and code number in 2014 as previous years, even though the underlying geography has changed.
