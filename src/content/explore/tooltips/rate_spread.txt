Rate spread is the difference between the annual percentage rate (APR) and the average prime offer rate (APOR) for a comparable loan or transaction. A loan is higher-priced if its rate spread is at least 1.5 percentage points for first-lien loans and 3.5 percentage points for subordinate lien loans. Rate spread is not reported for all other loans.
