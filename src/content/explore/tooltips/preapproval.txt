Some lenders have a preapproval program for an applicant  to undergo a comprehensive analysis of creditworthiness and receive a written commitment from the lender to extend a home purchase loan up to a specified amount for a designated period of time (subject to certain conditions). “Not Applicable” means the applicant did not request preapproval, the loan is being used for something other than home purchase, or the lender bought the loan on the secondary market.
