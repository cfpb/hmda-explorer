Some lenders have a preapproval program where an applicant undergoes a comprehensive analysis of their creditworthiness and receives a written commitment from the lender to extend a home purchase loan up to a specified amount for a designated amount of time (subject to certain conditions). “Not applicable” means the applicant did not request preapproval, the loan is being used for something other than purchasing a home, or the lender bought the loan on the secondary market.
