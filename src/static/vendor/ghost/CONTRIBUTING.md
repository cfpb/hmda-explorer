Edit the files in `src` and run `grunt build` whenever you're ready to compile LESS and automagically copy appropriate source files into the `dist` dir, archiving the examples in a .zip. Running `grunt` with no options will start a server on port 8000 (for testing the [examples](https://fake.ghe.domain/contolini/ghost/tree/master/src/examples) locally) and automatically `build` whenever a source file is changed.

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
