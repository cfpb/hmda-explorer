      <h2>How do I submit HMDA data collected in 2016?</h2>
      <p>There are no changes to the submission process for HMDA data collected by financial institutions in 2016. Financial institutions will file HMDA data with the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) using the FRB’s instructions, file specifications, and edits familiar to HMDA users. Please visit the <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/">FFIEC website</a> for resources to help you file.</p>

      <h2>How do I submit HMDA data collected in or after 2017?</h2>
      <p>There is a new data submission process beginning with HMDA data collected by financial institutions in or after 2017. Financial institutions will file HMDA data with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The HMDA agencies have agreed that filing HMDA data collected in or after 2017 with the CFPB will be deemed submission to the appropriate Federal agency. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/">FFIEC</a> and the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/for-filers">CFPB</a> websites for resources to help you file.</p>

      <h2>How do I resubmit HMDA data collected in or after 2017?</h2>
      <p>There is a new data resubmission process beginning with HMDA data collected by financial institutions in or after 2017. Financial institutions will resubmit HMDA data collected in or after 2017 by filing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/">FFIEC</a> and the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/for-filers">CFPB</a> websites for resources to help you file.</p>

      <h2>What type of browser do I need in order to use the CFPB’s HMDA Platform?</h2>
      <p>We recommend that HMDA filers use a modern browser, such as the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge, or other modern browsers.</p>

      <h2>What is a variable-width, pipe delimited text file?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>A pipe delimited text file is a file containing multiple data fields separated by a pipe character, “|”, to distinguish where each data field starts and ends. Files are stored in plain text as numbers and letters with one record per line.</li>
        <li>Data fields will vary in width, depending on the response.</li>
        <li>To leave a data field blank, as permitted in some cases by Regulation C and the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/for-filers">Filing Instructions Guide</a> (FIG), enter two consecutive pipes with no spaces in between the pipes, like this &ldquo;||&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>
          A pipe delimited text file for data collected in 2017 should look like this<sup>1</sup> :
          <img src="static/img/pipe-example.jpg" alt="Pipe delimited example" />
          <ol>
            <li>In a HMDA file, the first row begins with a &ldquo;1&rdquo;. All subsequent rows will begin with a &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>As the example demonstrates, depending on the data field, information can be of different lengths.</li>
            <li>Blank data fields are indicated by two consecutive pipes.</li>
          </ol>
          <hr />
          <sup>1 This example is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all the data fields reported in a row within the loan/application register. </sup>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>I need help formatting HMDA data into a pipe delimited text file. Is there a tool that can help?</h2>
      <p>A loan/application register formatting tool will be provided to help filers format certain data into a pipe delimited text file. This tool may be especially helpful for filers with small volumes of reported loans who do not use vendors or other software to prepare their HMDA data for submission. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/">FFIEC</a> and the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/for-filers">CFPB</a> websites for resources to help you file.</p>

      <h2>Can I use the HMDA Data Entry Software (DES) for data collected in or after 2017?</h2>
      <p>No. Data collected by financial institutions in or after 2017 will be filed online with the CFPB. The DES will continue to be used only for data collected in or before 2016. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/">FFIEC</a> and the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/for-filers">CFPB</a> websites for resources to help you file.</p>

      <h2>Where can I find the file specifications and edit specifications for HMDA data collected in or after 2017?</h2>
      <p>The Filing Instructions Guide (FIG) at the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/for-filers">CFPB website</a> contains the file specifications, edit specifications, and additional resources to help you file HMDA data collected in or after 2017.</p>

      <h2>How do I obtain an edit report for data collected in or after 2017?</h2>
      <p>The HMDA Platform will generate an edit report for your loan/application register prior to submission. The HMDA Platform requires filers to address all edits before allowing the loan/application register to be filed. The HMDA Platform will allow you to check your HMDA filing as many times as you would like prior to filing the final loan/application register with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>

      <h2>Can I submit HMDA data by the March 1st deadline with outstanding edits?</h2>
      <p>No. Beginning with the data collected in 2017, you will no longer be able to submit your HMDA data without correcting or validating all edits. All syntactical and validity edits must be corrected and quality and macro quality edits must be corrected or validated before you can file your HMDA data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>

      <h2>How do I know if my data has been received and processed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?</h2>
      <p>After you file, you will receive a confirmation receipt. Beginning with the data you collected in 2017, the CFPB’s HMDA Platform will not allow you to submit your loan/application register without addressing all edits and having an authorized representative of your institution with knowledge of the submitted data certify to the accuracy and completeness of the data.</p>

      <h2>Where can I find additional information about the HMDA Regulation C and filing my HMDA data?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>On October 15, 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a final rule (<a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201510_cfpb_final-rule_home-mortgage-disclosure_regulation-c.pdf">2015 HMDA Rule</a>) amending Regulation C. Additional resources to help institutions understand and comply with the 2015 HMDA Rule are available on the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda">CFPB website</a>.</li>
        <li>Technical questions about reporting HMDA data collected in or after 2017 should be directed to <a href="mailto:hmdahelp@cfpb.gov">hmdahelp@cfpb.gov</a> or (855) 438-2372.</li>
        <li>Technical questions about reporting HMDA data collected in or after 2016 should be directed to <a href="mailto:hmdahelp@frb.gov">hmdahelp@frb.gov</a>.</li>
