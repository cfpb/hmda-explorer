		<h2>HMDA Explorer Documentation</h2>
		<p>HMDA Explorer is a single page application that provides a landing page with visualizations and serves HMDA data from the Qu API. The code can be viewed in production at <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/hmda">http://consumerfinance.gov/hmda</a>.</p>
		<p>The Explorer's main functionality is contained in a number of modular JavaScript files that use event emitters and function calls to present information using filters on the home page.  These JavaScript files and their comments can be viewed in the included <a href="http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/">Docco</a> documents. Key files include the following: </p>
